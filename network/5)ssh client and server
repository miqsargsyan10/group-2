1. Install sshd on the server
	apt-get install openssh-server
2.Verify in the ssh configuration files that only protocol version 2 is allowed
	grep Protocol /etc/ssh/ssh*_config
3. Use ssh to log on to the server, show your current directory and then exit the server.
	ssh student@172.20.51.62
	pwd
	exit

4. Use scp to copy a file from your computer to the server.
	scp file.txt student@172.20.51.62:/home/student

5. Use scp to copy a file from the server to your computer.
	scp student@172.20.51.62:/home/student/file.txt .

6. (optional, only works when you have a graphical install of Linux) Install the xeyes package
on the server and use ssh to run xeyes on the server, but display it on your client.
	on the server:
	sudo apt install x11-apps
	on the client:
	ssh -X student@172.20.51.62
	xeyes

8. Use ssh-keygen to create a key pair without passphrase. Setup passwordless ssh between you and your neighbour. (or between your client and your server)
	ssh-keygen -t rsa
	chmod 700 .ssh/
	scp id_rsa.pub bob@192.168.48.92:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

9.Verify that the permissions on the server key files are correct; world readable for the public keys and only root access for the private keys.
	ls -l /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*

10. Verify that the ssh-agent is running.
	ps fax | grep ssh-agent

11. (optional) Protect your keypair with a passphrase, then add this key to the ssh-agent and test your passwordless ssh to the server.
	man ssh-keygen
	man ssh-agent
	man ssh-add
